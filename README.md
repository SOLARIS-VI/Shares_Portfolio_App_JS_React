# Stocks & Shares Portfolio

**BRIEF:**

A local trader has approached our team with a portfolio of shares. They want to be able to analyze it more effectively. They have a small sample dataset to give you and would like you to build a Minimum Viable Product that uses the data to display their portfolio so that they can make better decisions when choosing stocks and shares.

**MVP**

The user should be able to:

1. View total current value.
2. View individual and total performance trends.
3. Retrieve a list of share prices from an external API and allow the user to add shares to her portfolio.
4. View a chart of the current values in her portfolio.

**EXTENSIONS:**

1. Speculation based on trends and further financial modeling using projections.
2. Include add and delete buttons for shares.
3. Add a pie chart to one of the webpages.
4. Add a candle chart to one of the webpages.

# Technologies Used

- JavaScript
- React
- Node.js
- Google Charts

**MVP:**
- Plan thoroughly so youâ€™re all clear about the aim for the end result. Set out an MVP that doesn't contain any
  features that are not crucial to the functioning of the application. Split the project into small features to tackle one at a time.

**Setup:**
- It can work well to set up the basic app, directories, etc., together first so you all understand the
  core structure before you split up to work on different features. Use git branches and commit and merge regularly.

**Helpful Hints to Avoid Common Gotchas:**

APIs:
- Investigate the APIs you are planning to use and make sure you can get the data back you need
  into your application before writing code dependent on that API.

- Check for daily/hourly usage limits.

- When making a request to an API, if you get a CORS error in the console, speak to an instructor
  and we'll give you notes on making server-side requests, which will solve the problem.

- Don't push your API keys up to GitHub.

**How to Run the Project:**

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

Installs:

API
In terminal:
- npm i finnhub
- npm i querystring-es3

Then:

1. Open client > node_modules > react-scripts > config > webpack.config.js
2. Command-F and search for "fallback"
3. In "resolve" object, add: fallback:

{
"querystring": require.resolve("querystring-es3"),
},

Node Modules
In terminal:
- npm install

Run Client & Server
Open two terminals within VScode or chosen IDE:

- cd into the project, then cd into client then run npm start
- cd into the project, then cd into server then run npm start
